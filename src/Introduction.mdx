# Panel Extension Starter

Welcome to the **Panel Extension Starter** documentation!

This Storybook provides interactive documentation and examples for building panel extensions compatible with `@principal-ade/panel-framework-core`.

## What Are Panel Extensions?

Panel extensions are React components distributed via NPM that can be dynamically loaded into panel-compatible host applications. They follow the [Panel Extension Store Specification V2](https://github.com/principal-ade/panel-framework/blob/main/PANEL_EXTENSION_STORE_SPECIFICATION_V2.md).

### Key Features

- 📦 **NPM Distribution** - Published and installed like any NPM package
- 🔌 **Framework Integration** - Full access to host application context, actions, and events
- 🎨 **Type Safe** - Complete TypeScript support
- 🚀 **Multi-Panel Support** - Single package can export multiple related panels
- ⚡ **Dependency Sharing** - React/ReactDOM provided by host, other deps bundled

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. **Customize your panel**
   - Edit `src/panels/ExamplePanel.tsx`
   - Update `src/index.tsx` with your panel metadata

3. **Develop with Storybook**

   ```bash
   bun run storybook
   ```

4. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```

### Project Structure

```

├── src/
│   ├── panels/           # Your panel components
│   ├── types/            # TypeScript definitions
│   ├── mocks/            # Storybook mocks
│   └── index.tsx         # Main entry - exports panels array
├── .storybook/           # Storybook configuration
└── dist/                 # Build output (generated)
```

## Panel Component API

Every panel component receives these props from the host application:

### Context

Access to shared data and state:

- Repository information
- Git status
- File tree
- Data slices (git, markdown, packages, quality)
- Loading states
- Refresh methods

### Actions

Interact with the host application:

- `openFile(path)` - Open a file in the editor
- `openGitDiff(path, status)` - View git diff
- `navigateToPanel(id)` - Navigate to another panel
- `notifyPanels(event)` - Send notifications

### Events

Subscribe to and emit panel events:

- `events.on(type, handler)` - Subscribe to events
- `events.emit(event)` - Emit custom events
- `events.off(type, handler)` - Unsubscribe

## Storybook Features
